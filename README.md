# Messenger

This is a bare-bones instant messenger application built for week3 of Ember in our JavaScript Course at Epicodus. Minimal styling, computed properties, a custom helper and service has been added.

Issues: Moment/computed sort could not be implemented on the question model. There is a slight issue with the fixed footers. Other than that everthing functions fine.
